# Point of Sale 

##About 
This project is completed by Katharine Chen for the Active Record assessment for Epicodus. 

##Description 
The objective of this project is to make a point of sale (POS)system for a convenience store, using Active Record. A POS is a system that lets cashiers ring up customers for their purchase. The project must include at least one one-to-many relationship, and one many-to-many relationship, using at least one scope, validation, and callback.  

##Functionality 

-Store managers can add a new product to the POS, with its name and price, so they can keep track of what we're selling.

-Store managers can create logins for cashiers, so store managers know who is responsible for ringing up which purchases.

##Installation

##Items to Complete 

-As a cashier, I want to choose which products and how many of each a customer is purchasing, so that I can see what their total cost is.

-As a customer, I want to see a receipt on the screen, so that I can make sure that the cashier rang me up correctly and told me the right total. I would like the cashier to be able to print out the receipt, but that ain't gonna happen ;)

-As a store manager, I want to see the total amount of sales for a date range of my choosing, so that I can keep track of how much money I am making.

-As a manager, I want to see number of customers each cashier has checked out in a date range of my choosing, so that I can see who is the most efficient.

-As a customer, I want to be able to return items, so that I can bring back things I don't want.

-As a store manager, I want to see which products are most popular, so I can order more of them.

-As a store manager, I want to see which items are returned most often, so I can catch any quality problems.
