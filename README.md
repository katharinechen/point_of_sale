# Point of Sale 

The object of this project is to make a point of sale (POS) system for a convenience store. A POS is a system that lets cashiers ring up customers for their purchase. 

The model assumes an infinitef inventory. 


The goal of this assessment is to create a program using Active Record, including an one-to-many relationshop or a many-to-many relationship, using at least one scope, validation, and callback. 
(1) One-to-many relationship

	cashier has customers 
	cashier has sold many products 
	customer has many products 

(2) Many-to-many relationship
	
	products and customers 

(3) Scope

(4) Validation

(5) Callbacks

#Things to Work on: 


(1) As a cashier, I want to choose which products and how many of each a customer is purchasing, so that I can see what their total cost is.

(2) As a customer, I want to see a receipt on the screen, so that I can make sure that the cashier rang me up correctly and told me the right total. I would like the cashier to be able to print out the receipt, but that ain't gonna happen ;)


(3) As a store manager, I want to see the total amount of sales for a date range of my choosing, so that I can keep track of how much money I am making.

(4) As a manager, I want to see number of customers each cashier has checked out in a date range of my choosing, so that I can see who is the most efficient.

(5) As a customer, I want to be able to return items, so that I can bring back things I don't want.

(6) As a store manager, I want to see which products are most popular, so I can order more of them.

(7) As a store manager, I want to see which items are returned most often, so I can catch any quality problems.
